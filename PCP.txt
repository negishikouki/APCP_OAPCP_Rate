PCP:PvP CP = (SCP*10)^(3/2)*DPT[PvP]*10^(-4)

where:
10^(-4) is a scale factor
DPT[PvP] = DPT[fast move] * STF[fast move] * ME[fast move] + EPT[fast move] * DPE[charge move] * STF[charge move] * ME[charge move]
STF:Same Type Factor = (SameType ? 1.2 : 1)
ME:Move Effect=1.6^(TypeChart[MoveType, OppositeType1] + TypeChart[MoveType, OppositeType2])

APCP:Average PCP = ƒ°(PCP[x])
OAPCP:Opposite APCP = ƒ°(Opposite PCP[x])

APCP probably represents average winnability. That is as better as bigger:)
OAPCP probably represents average defeatabilty. That is as better as smaller:(

APCP / OAPCP Rate is a better index for selecting Pokemons to give you an edge in PvP!!
